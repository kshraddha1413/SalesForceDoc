*Introduction to Data Import*
=======
Salesforce offers two main methods for importing data.
1)Data Import Wizard
2)Data Loader

**Use the Data Import Wizard When:**

You need to load less than 50,000 records.
The objects you need to import are supported by the wizard.
You donâ€™t need the import process to be automated.

**Use Data Loader When:**

You need to load 50,000 to five million records. If you need to load more than 5 million records, we recommend you work with a Salesforce partner or visit the AppExchange for a suitable partner product.
You need to load into an object that is not supported by the Data Import Wizard.
You want to schedule regular data loads, such as nightly imports.


**Standard Profiles**
The platform includes a set of standard profiles. Some examples are:

Read Only
Standard User
Marketing User
Contract Manager
System Administrator

The System Administrator profile also includes two special permissions:
View All Data
Modify All Data
